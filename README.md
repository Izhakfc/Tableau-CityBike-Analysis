# Tableau-CityBike-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
In this module, we looked at the bikesharing data for the month of August in New York City. The purpose for this Analysis is to find relevant data that allows you to develop an strategy to sell the idea of bringing bikesharing to Des Moines. We can analyze the various types of data from New York and get a scope of who uses the bikesharing service, the traffic hours, most common users, and then develop a business model that can be replicated in New York.

## Results

A set of different graphs were created in order to display our findings, the graphs are the next ones:

The first graph looked at the most popular hours for bike riding in NYC. We can observe that there is a slight peak in bike usage from 7am to 9am, and a bigger peak, at around 5pm to 7pm. The first peak could relate to people using their bikes to get to their works, and the later peaks probably relates to people performing excercise or other ourdoors activities.

In this graph we have the locations of the starting points for bikesharing users (on the left) and the ending stations locations (on the right). With this graph we can see that there is a denser layer of circles (representing the bike users) on the left site of the map, probably related to the touristic attractions that are in that area compared to the upper part of the map, where there are more universities and green areas.

The trip durations of bike rides was analyzed in this graph, we observe trip durations tend to be around 5 minutes long, and then the count of bike users reduces as the time of the trip duration increases. We can infer by this that bikesharing users only use the service to move quickly throught the city, or to relatively close locations, since there are almost none trips with a duration greater than 1 hour.

This dashboard give us a scope of the bikesharing users habits by gender. ItÂ´s clear that male users are the most common users of this service. However, female and unkown gender users tend to use the service for longer periods of time. We can also see the days with more bike traffic, the day with the most traffic is Thursday from around 4pm to 9pm.

## Summary

Based on this analysis we can conclude that:
* The hours with more bike traffic are between 5pm to 8pm.
* Male suscriber users tend to use the bikesharing service far more often than females an unkown gender users.
* Female users and Unkown gender users tend to use the service, hence, unkown gender users could be tourist that travel longer distances.
* Thursday is the bussiest day of the week.

### Further Analysis
I will recommend analysing the average distance of each ride to define a certain range of kilometers before the bikes need to get to maintenance, an also it will be beneficial to analyze the most used routes, in order to create an advertising strategy for the service.
